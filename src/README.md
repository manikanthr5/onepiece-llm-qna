# Code Documentation

This README file provides an overview of the code in the `src` folder for the LLM Chat for One Piece Wiki project.

## Data Collection

The data collection module is responsible for gathering data from the One Piece Wiki. It includes scripts for scraping relevant information such as character names, descriptions, and other details.

## Pretraining

The pretraining module focuses on training a language model using a large corpus of text data. It involves techniques like unsupervised learning and self-supervised learning to build a base model that can understand natural language.

## Supervised Finetuning

The supervised finetuning module is used to fine-tune the pre-trained language model using labeled data. In this case, it involves training the model to generate responses for a given prompt based on the One Piece Wiki data. This step helps the model learn specific patterns and information related to the One Piece universe.

## RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

The RLHF module is responsible for further improving the language model's responses through reinforcement learning. It involves collecting human feedback on generated responses and using that feedback to train the model to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

## LLM Chat API for One Piece Wiki

The LLM Chat API for One Piece Wiki is the main application that utilizes the trained language model to provide a chatbot-like experience for One Piece fans. It allows users to interact with the model by asking questions or engaging in conversations related to the One Piece universe.

For more detailed information on each module and how to use them, please refer to the individual code files in the `src` folder.
